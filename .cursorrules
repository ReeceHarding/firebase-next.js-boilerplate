# Project Instructions

Use specification and guidelines as you build the app.

Write the complete code for every step. Do not get lazy.

Your goal is to completely finish whatever I ask for.

You will see <ai_context> tags in the code. These are context tags that you should use to help you understand the codebase.

## Rules

Follow these rules when building the app.

### General Rules

- Use `@` to import anything from the app unless otherwise specified
- Use kebab case for all files and folders unless otherwise specified
- Don't update shadcn components unless otherwise specified

#### Env Rules

- If you update environment variables, update the `.env.example` file
- All environment variables should go in `.env.local`
- Do not expose environment variables to the frontend
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for environment variables that need to be accessed from the frontend
- You may import environment variables in server actions and components by using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`

#### Type Rules

Follow these rules when working with types.

- When importing types, use `@/types`
- Name files like `example-types.ts`
- All types should go in `types`
- Make sure to export the types in `types/index.ts`
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases
- Use Firebase types from `@/types/firebase-types`

An example of a type:

`types/actions-types.ts`

```ts
export type ActionState<T> =
  | { isSuccess: true; message: string; data: T }
  | { isSuccess: false; message: string; data?: never }
```

And exporting it:

`types/index.ts`

```ts
export * from "./actions-types"
```

### Frontend Rules

Follow these rules when working on the frontend.

It uses Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn, and Framer Motion.

#### General Rules

- Use `lucide-react` for icons
- useSidebar must be used within a SidebarProvider

#### Components

- Use divs instead of other html tags unless otherwise specified
- Separate the main parts of a component's html with an extra blank line for visual spacing
- Always tag a component with either `use server` or `use client` at the top, including layouts and pages

##### Organization

- All components be named using kebab case like `example-component.tsx` unless otherwise specified
- Put components in `/_components` in the route if one-off components
- Put components in `/components` from the root if shared components

##### Data Fetching

- Fetch data in server components and pass the data down as props to client components.
- Use server actions from `/actions` to mutate data.

##### Server Components

- Use `"use server"` at the top of the file.
- Implement Suspense for asynchronous data fetching to show loading states while data is being fetched.
- If no asynchronous logic is required for a given server component, you do not need to wrap the component in `<Suspense>`. You can simply return the final UI directly since there is no async boundary needed.
- If asynchronous fetching is required, you can use a `<Suspense>` boundary and a fallback to indicate a loading state while data is loading.
- Server components cannot be imported into client components. If you want to use a server component in a client component, you must pass the as props using the "children" prop
- params in server pages should be awaited such as `const { courseId } = await params` where the type is `params: Promise<{ courseId: string }>`

Example of a server layout:

```tsx
"use server"

export default async function ExampleServerLayout({
  children
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return children
}
```

Example of a server page (with async logic):

```tsx
"use server"

import { Suspense } from "react"
import { SomeAction } from "@/actions/some-actions"
import SomeComponent from "./_components/some-component"
import SomeSkeleton from "./_components/some-skeleton"

export default async function ExampleServerPage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<SomeSkeleton className="some-class" />}>
      <SomeComponentFetcher />
    </Suspense>
  )
}

async function SomeComponentFetcher() {
  const { data } = await SomeAction()
  return <SomeComponent className="some-class" initialData={data || []} />
}
```

Example of a server page (no async logic required):

```tsx
"use server"

import SomeClientComponent from "./_components/some-client-component"

// In this case, no asynchronous work is being done, so no Suspense or fallback is required.
export default async function ExampleServerPage() {
  return <SomeClientComponent initialData={[]} />
}
```

Example of a server component:

```tsx
"use server"

interface ExampleServerComponentProps {
  // Your props here
}

export async function ExampleServerComponent({
  props
}: ExampleServerComponentProps) {
  // Your code here
}
```

##### Client Components

- Use `"use client"` at the top of the file
- Client components can safely rely on props passed down from server components, or handle UI interactions without needing <Suspense> if there's no async logic.
- Never use server actions in client components. If you need to create a new server action, create it in `/actions`

Example of a client page:

```tsx
"use client"

export default function ExampleClientPage() {
  // Your code here
}
```

Example of a client component:

```tsx
"use client"

interface ExampleClientComponentProps {
  initialData: any[]
}

export default function ExampleClientComponent({
  initialData
}: ExampleClientComponentProps) {
  // Client-side logic here
  return <div>{initialData.length} items</div>
}
```

### Backend Rules

Follow these rules when working on the backend.

It uses Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage.

#### General Rules

- Use Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations
- Use Firebase Client SDK for client-side operations
- Always handle errors gracefully

#### Organization

#### Database (Firestore)

- Collections are defined in `db/db.ts`
- Use the `collections` object to reference collection names
- Always include proper error handling
- Use transactions for operations that need to be atomic

Example of Firestore operations:

```ts
// Creating a document
const docRef = await db.collection(collections.profiles).add(data)

// Getting a document
const doc = await db.collection(collections.profiles).doc(id).get()

// Querying documents
const snapshot = await db
  .collection(collections.profiles)
  .where('userId', '==', userId)
  .get()

// Updating a document
await db.collection(collections.profiles).doc(id).update(data)

// Deleting a document
await db.collection(collections.profiles).doc(id).delete()
```

#### Server Actions

- When importing actions, use `@/actions` or `@/actions/db` if db related
- DB related actions should go in the `actions/db` folder
- Storage related actions should go in the `actions/storage` folder
- Other actions should go in the `actions` folder
- Name files like `example-actions.ts`
- All actions should go in the `actions` folder
- Only write the needed actions
- Return an ActionState with the needed data type from actions
- Include Action at the end of function names `Ex: exampleFunction -> exampleFunctionAction`
- Actions should return a Promise<ActionState<T>>
- Sort in CRUD order: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Make sure to return undefined as the data type if the action is not supposed to return any data

```ts
export type ActionState<T> =
  | { isSuccess: true; message: string; data: T }
  | { isSuccess: false; message: string; data?: never }
```

Example of an action:

`actions/db/profiles-actions.ts`

```ts
"use server"

import { db, collections } from "@/db/db"
import { FirebaseProfile } from "@/types/firebase-types"
import { ActionState } from "@/types"
import { FieldValue } from 'firebase-admin/firestore'

export async function createProfileAction(
  data: Omit<FirebaseProfile, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'>
): Promise<ActionState<FirebaseProfile>> {
  try {
    const profileData = {
      ...data,
      createdAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
      updatedAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
    }
    
    const docRef = await db.collection(collections.profiles).add(profileData)
    const newProfile = await docRef.get()
    const profileWithId = { id: docRef.id, ...newProfile.data() } as FirebaseProfile
    
    return {
      isSuccess: true,
      message: "Profile created successfully",
      data: profileWithId
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating profile:", error)
    return { isSuccess: false, message: "Failed to create profile" }
  }
}
```

### Auth Rules

Follow these rules when working on auth.

It uses Firebase Authentication.

#### General Rules

- Import the auth helper with `import { auth } from "@/lib/firebase-auth"` in server components
- Use `import { auth } from "@/lib/firebase-client"` in client components
- await the auth helper in server actions
- Use session cookies for server-side authentication

### Payments Rules

Follow these rules when working on payments.

It uses Stripe for payments.

### Analytics Rules

Follow these rules when working on analytics.

It uses PostHog for analytics.

# Storage Rules

Follow these rules when working with Firebase Storage.

It uses Firebase Storage for file uploads, downloads, and management.

## General Rules

- Always use environment variables for bucket names to maintain consistency across environments
- Never hardcode bucket names in the application code
- Always handle file size limits and allowed file types at the application level
- Always implement proper error handling for storage operations
- Use content-type headers when uploading files to ensure proper file handling

## Organization

### Buckets

- Name buckets in kebab-case: `user-uploads`, `profile-images`
- Create separate buckets for different types of files (e.g., `profile-images`, `documents`, `attachments`)
- Document bucket purposes in a central location
- Set appropriate bucket permissions based on access requirements

### File Structure

- Organize files in folders based on their purpose and ownership
- Use predictable, collision-resistant naming patterns
- Structure: `{bucket}/{userId}/{purpose}/{filename}`
- Example: `profile-images/123e4567-e89b/avatar/profile.jpg`
- Include timestamps in filenames when version history is important
- Example: `documents/123e4567-e89b/contracts/2024-02-13-contract.pdf`

## Actions

- When importing storage actions, use `@/actions/storage`
- Name files like `example-storage-actions.ts`
- Include StorageAction at the end of function names `Ex: uploadFile -> uploadFileStorageAction`
- Follow the same ActionState pattern as DB actions

Example of a storage action:

```ts
"use server"

import { adminStorage } from '@/lib/firebase-config'
import { ActionState } from '@/types'

export async function uploadFileStorageAction(
  bucket: string,
  path: string,
  buffer: Buffer,
  contentType: string
): Promise<ActionState<{ path: string; url: string }>> {
  try {
    const file = adminStorage.bucket(bucket).file(path)
    
    await file.save(buffer, {
      metadata: {
        contentType: contentType
      }
    })
    
    const [url] = await file.getSignedUrl({
      action: 'read',
      expires: Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 7 days
    })
    
    return {
      isSuccess: true,
      message: "File uploaded successfully",
      data: { path, url }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error uploading file:", error)
    return { isSuccess: false, message: "Failed to upload file" }
  }
}
```

## File Handling

### Upload Rules

- Always validate file size before upload
- Implement file type validation using both extension and MIME type
- Generate unique filenames to prevent collisions
- Set appropriate content-type headers
- Handle existing files appropriately (error or overwrite)

Example validation:

```ts
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024 // 10MB
const ALLOWED_TYPES = ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/webp"]

function validateFile(file: File): boolean {
  if (file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
    throw new Error("File size exceeds limit")
  }

  if (!ALLOWED_TYPES.includes(file.type)) {
    throw new Error("File type not allowed")
  }

  return true
}
```

### Download Rules

- Always handle missing files gracefully
- Implement proper error handling for failed downloads
- Use signed URLs for private files

### Delete Rules

- Implement soft deletes when appropriate
- Clean up related database records when deleting files
- Handle bulk deletions carefully
- Verify ownership before deletion

## Security

### Access Control

- Generate short-lived signed URLs for private files
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use separate buckets for public and private files
- Never expose internal file paths
- Validate user permissions before any operation

## Error Handling

- Implement specific error types for common storage issues
- Always provide meaningful error messages
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Log storage errors separately for monitoring

## Optimization

- Implement progressive upload for large files
- Clean up temporary files and failed uploads
- Use batch operations when handling multiple files
