## Overview

This guide establishes industry best practices for creating production-ready AI prompts. These guidelines ensure consistency, reliability, and optimal performance across all AI interactions.

### Why This Matters
- **Consistency**: Standardized prompts produce predictable results
- **Reliability**: Well-structured prompts reduce errors and hallucinations
- **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes prompts easier to update and debug
- **Performance**: Optimized prompts improve response quality and speed

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Clarity Over Cleverness**
- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid ambiguous terms or complex sentence structures
- Be explicit about requirements rather than assuming understanding

### 2. **Structure Over Stream-of-Consciousness**
- Organize information hierarchically
- Use clear sections and subsections
- Separate different types of instructions

### 3. **Specificity Over Generality**
- Provide concrete examples rather than abstract concepts
- Define exact requirements and constraints
- Specify desired output format explicitly

### 4. **Testability Over Assumption**
- Include validation criteria
- Provide clear success/failure conditions
- Make requirements measurable

## XML Structure & Tags

### Essential XML Tags

#### `<system>`
Sets the overall context and persona for the AI.

```xml
<system>
You are a senior software engineer with 10+ years of experience in full-stack development. 
You specialize in React, Node.js, and cloud architecture. Your responses should be 
professional, technically accurate, and include practical examples.
</system>
```

#### `<context>`
Provides background information and current situation.

```xml
<context>
The user is working on a Next.js application with TypeScript. They have a Firebase backend 
and are implementing user authentication. The app follows modern React patterns with hooks 
and functional components.
</context>
```

#### `<task>`
Defines the specific task or goal to accomplish.

```xml
<task>
Create a reusable authentication hook that handles login, logout, and user state management. 
The hook should integrate with Firebase Auth and provide loading states and error handling.
</task>
```

#### `<constraints>`
Lists limitations, requirements, and boundaries.

```xml
<constraints>
- Must use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Must handle loading states and errors gracefully
- Must follow React hooks conventions
- Must be compatible with Next.js 13+ App Router
- Must include proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
</constraints>
```

#### `<examples>`
Provides concrete examples of expected input/output.

```xml
<examples>
<example>
Input: User attempts login with email/password
Output: Hook returns { user: User | null, loading: boolean, error: string | null, login: Function }
</example>
</examples>
```

#### `<output_format>`
Specifies the exact format of the response.

```xml
<output_format>
1. Complete TypeScript code with proper imports
2. Inline comments explaining key logic
3. Usage example showing how to implement the hook
4. Error handling explanation
5. Testing considerations
</output_format>
```

### Advanced XML Tags

#### `<reasoning>`
For complex problems, show the thinking process.

```xml
<reasoning>
Before implementing the solution, I need to consider:
1. State management approach (useState vs useReducer)
2. Side effect handling (useEffect patterns)
3. Error boundary integration
4. Performance optimization (useMemo/useCallback)
</reasoning>
```

#### `<validation>`
Define how to verify the solution works.

```xml
<validation>
Success criteria:
- Hook properly manages authentication state
- Loading states are handled correctly
- Errors are caught and displayed appropriately
- No memory leaks or infinite re-renders
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
</validation>
```

#### `<dependencies>`
List required libraries or prerequisites.

```xml
<dependencies>
- firebase: ^9.0.0
- next: ^13.0.0
- react: ^18.0.0
- typescript: ^5.0.0
</dependencies>
```

6. Document the implementation and usage
</instructions>
```

#### **Requirement-Based Instructions**
```xml
<requirements>
MUST:

</requirements>
```

#### **Conditional Instructions**
```xml
<conditional_logic>
IF the user is authenticated:
  - Show the dashboard with user-specific data
  - Enable full functionality
  - Track user actions for analytics

IF the user is not authenticated:
  - Show login/signup forms
  - Limit functionality to read-only
  - Redirect to login after 30 seconds of inactivity

IF there's an authentication error:
  - Show clear error message
  - Provide recovery options
  - Log error for debugging
</conditional_logic>
```

## Example Patterns

### Example Structure

#### **Basic Example**
```xml
<example>
<input>
User clicks "Login" button with email: "user@example.com" and password: "password123"
</input>
<process>
1. Validate input format
2. Call Firebase Auth signInWithEmailAndPassword
3. Handle success/error responses
4. Update application state
</process>
<output>
Success: User object with authentication token, redirect to dashboard
Error: Clear error message, keep user on login page
</output>
</example>
```

#### **Complex Example with Multiple Scenarios**
```xml
<examples>
<example name="successful_login">
<input>
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "validPassword123",
  "rememberMe": true
}
</input>
<output>
{
  "success": true,
  "user": {
    "uid": "user123",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "displayName": "John Doe"
  },
  "redirect": "/dashboard"
}
</output>
</example>

<example name="invalid_credentials">
<input>
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "wrongPassword",
  "rememberMe": false
}
</input>
<output>
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid email or password",
  "field": "password",
  "code": "auth/wrong-password"
}
</output>
</example>
</examples>
```

#### **Edge Case Examples**
```xml
<edge_cases>
<example name="network_error">
<scenario>User attempts login but network is unavailable</scenario>
<expected_behavior>
- Show "Network error, please check your connection" message
- Retry button appears after 3 seconds
- Form remains populated with user data
</expected_behavior>
</example>

<example name="rate_limiting">
<scenario>User exceeds login attempts (5 failed attempts in 10 minutes)</scenario>
<expected_behavior>
- Show "Too many attempts, please try again in 10 minutes" message
- Disable login form temporarily
- Suggest password reset option
</expected_behavior>
</example>
</edge_cases>
```

### Example Best Practices

1. **Cover Common Scenarios**: Include typical use cases
2. **Include Edge Cases**: Handle error conditions and unusual inputs
3. **Show Complete Data**: Don't use "..." or abbreviated examples
4. **Use Real Data**: Realistic usernames, emails, and content
5. **Demonstrate Variations**: Show different input/output combinations

    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "User-friendly error message",
    "details": "Technical details for debugging",
    "field": "specific_field_name",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "requestId": "uuid-for-tracking"
  }
}
</error_format>
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain of Thought Prompting

```xml
<chain_of_thought>
Before implementing the solution, let me think through this step by step:

1. **Problem Analysis**: What exactly needs to be solved?
2. **Constraint Identification**: What limitations do we have?
3. **Solution Design**: What approach would work best?
4. **Implementation Planning**: What steps are needed?
5. **Validation Strategy**: How will we verify success?
</chain_of_thought>
```

### Few-Shot Learning

```xml
<few_shot_examples>
<example_1>
Task: Create a login form
Implementation: [Complete code example]
Outcome: Functional, accessible login form with proper validation
</example_1>

<example_2>
Task: Implement user registration
Implementation: [Complete code example]
Outcome: Registration form with email verification and error handling
</example_2>

<example_3>
Task: Add password reset functionality
Implementation: [Complete code example]
Outcome: Complete password reset flow with email integration
</example_3>
</few_shot_examples>
```

### Iterative Refinement

```xml
<refinement_process>
1. **Initial Implementation**: Basic working solution
2. **Review Requirements**: Check against all specifications
3. **Identify Gaps**: What's missing or could be improved?
4. **Enhance Solution**: Add missing features and optimizations
5. **Final Validation**: Ensure all requirements are met
</refinement_process>
```

### Self-Correction

```xml
<self_correction>
Let me review my solution against the requirements:
- ✅ Uses TypeScript with proper types
- ✅ Implements error handling
- ✅ Follows accessibility guidelines
- ❌ Missing comprehensive tests
- ❌ Could improve performance with memoization

I need to add tests and performance optimizations.
</self_correction>
```
