## 🔄 Migration Notes

### Database Collections
The following Firestore collections are configured:
- `profiles` - User profiles
- `users` - User data
- `todos` - Example todo items
- `chats` - Chat conversations
- `messages` - Chat messages

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs in with Firebase Auth (Email/Password or Google)
2. Client sends ID token to server
3. Server creates secure session cookie
4. Middleware validates session for protected routes

### Storage Buckets
Configure these buckets in Firebase Storage:
- `user-uploads` - General user uploads
- `profile-images` - User profile pictures
- `documents` - Document storage

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

1. **Firestore Rules**: Apply the security rules from the setup script
2. **Storage Rules**: Configure bucket-level permissions
3. **Session Security**: Sessions expire after 5 days
4. **Environment Variables**: Never commit Firebase credentials

## 📚 Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with Firebase setup instructions
- Updated all rule files in `.cursor/rules/`
- Removed all Supabase and Clerk references

## 🎉 Features Retained
- ✅ Stripe payment integration
- ✅ PostHog analytics
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Server-side rendering
- ✅ TypeScript support

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Firebase Admin SDK not initialized"**
   - Ensure service account JSON file exists
   - Check FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH in .env.local

2. **"Auth not working"**
   - Enable authentication providers in Firebase Console
   - Add your domain to authorized domains

3. **"Firestore permission denied"**
   - Apply security rules from setup script
   - Check collection names match configuration

## 📞 Support
If you encounter issues:
1. Check Firebase Console for errors
2. Review browser console logs
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Ensure all Firebase services are enabled
